# Video Lag Tester

A Video Lag Tester is a device that measures the delay from when a signal is sent to a displays input until it is shown on the display. In most cases this is an important parameters for a good gaming experince.

It is intended to be a low cost solution for video signals up to 720p 60 Hz. The cost for building it your self is ~$25 or less.

You can build it as described below or use the [PCB by Zwenergy](https://github.com/zwenergy/Tang-Nano-4k-Video-Lag-Tester-Mini-Shield)

## Case
There is a [case designed by john3d](https://www.printables.com/model/395088-case-for-video-lag-tester-mini-shield-by-zwenergy) that can be 3D Printed. It fits with the PCB by Zwenergy.

## Flash firmware
Download and unpack the [release zip file](https://github.com/pthalin/video_lag_tester/releases/latest/). Plug in a USB-C cable to the board. No driver needs to be installed.

### Linux:
Install [openFPGALoader](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader)

run:\
openFPGALoader -b tangnano4k -f firmware\\video_lag_tester_720p60.fs

### Windows:
Double click on "load_720p.cmd"
